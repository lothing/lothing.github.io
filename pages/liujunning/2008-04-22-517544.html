Mr. Li, 80, was born in 1923 in Wuxi City, Jiangsu province, into a merchant family with a cultural and patriotic tradition. This was a determining factor in shaping his world outlook. His father was a well-educated business manager. His grandfather had joined the 1911 Nationalist revolution. Mr. Li received a western-style education and graduated in economics from Yenching University in Beijing before joining Mao’s Communist movement.<br />Mr. Li’s had a varied and rich career. As a China’s major foreign policy adviser and strategist, Mr. Li played an important role in promoting China’s moderate attitude and later opening up policy toward the West. He was foreign policy adviser to Premier Zhou Enlai in the early 1950s. In 1954, Li was one of those suggesting the practice of circulating extracts of reports from the Western media, called “internal references,” among the Communist leadership. This allowed leaders to receive information from the West at a time when China was internationally isolated.<br />In the late 1970s, Li was sought out by Deng Xiaoping for advice on China’s foreign policy, especially its policy toward the U.S. Thereafter, as foreign policy adviser, he accompanied Deng on his visit to the U.S. in 1979. He also served as a special assistant to Premier Zhao Ziyang during his visit to the U.S. in 1984. Mr. Li supported and argued for engagement with the U.S. for many decades. Although his proposal of engagement with the U.S. was adopted by Deng and his successors, many Communist hardliners and New Left intellectuals continued to oppose him. In the 1990s, Li became a pioneer in promoting globalization studies in China. He believed that a thorough opening up would help speed up China’s democratic transition and contribute to world peace.<br />As a forerunner and founding father of American studies in China, Li set up the Institute of American Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) in 1981. In 1988, he founded the Chinese Association for American Studies.<br />Mr. Li’s fame and popularity as a courageous and respected academic were closely related to his unremitting critique of the Communist ideology and practice in China. Mr. Li had his first major brush with top Chinese leader Mao Zedong in 1956, shortly before the notorious Anti-Rightist Movement, when he appealed to the top authorities for a grand, fundamental democracy, by which he meant a liberal representative democracy. He later ran afoul with the authorities by refusing to attend a conference that declared martial law in Beijing on May 19, 1989. Thereafter, he resigned as the deputy president of CASS. “I don’t want to be an official under the point of a bayonet,” Li said. As a result, he was thereafter deprived of his position in the National People’s Congress.<br />In the early 1990s Mr. Li began a decade-long critique of the regime. In an essay circulated clandestinely, on paper, through email, and on the Internet, among the community of intellectuals and retired officials, he was markedly explicit, mocking the lavish celebration of 50 years of Communist rule in 1999, and warning General Secretary Jiang Zemin about the need to end the Communist Party’s continuing monopoly on political power. “Hitler is dead, Stalin is dead; there can’t be that many countries left that strive for this vision of grandeur,” he wrote. “My own guess is perhaps only Kim Jong Il’s Korea would embrace it.” That article solidified Li’s role as a liberal<br />democrat. Consequently, he was blacklisted and criticized for his “improper” slander.<br />What will be remembered most is Mr. Li’s contribution to the resurgence of liberalism in China and his courage in calling for liberal democracy under the present-day Communist rule.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;As an indomitable champion of liberal democracy, Li wrote extensively to advocate and expound upon liberalism. The year 1998 highlighted the liberalist revival, and when Peking University’s centennial was celebrated, Li wrote a preface to a special volume entitled “Peking University and the Liberal Tradition in Modern China,” in which he wrote “through comparisons and choices in the world over the last two or three hundred years, especially the mankind’s largest experiments in China for over a hundred years, we have plenty of reason to believe that liberalism &gt; is the best and most universal value. The revival of the liberalist tradition originating at Peking University will bring a free China to a globalizing world, and will be beneficial and glorious for the entire world.” Li’s words have been regarded as a declaration of the rebirth of liberalism in China. At the time of his death, Mr. Li had become a leading voice in the movement for democratization in China. In his last speech several weeks before his death, Mr. Li asserted that the primary goal of China’s modernization is democratization.<br />In democratic countries, those people who make contributions to the enterprise of freedom and democracy deserve and receive high honors. But in China, liberal democrat Li Shenzhi’s only honor was repeated punishment. Mr. Li was seriously attacked during Mao’s anti-rightist movement in 1957 and labeled a “rightist” - a term used to brand those who criticized the Chinese Communist Party and questioned the one party-rule. As a result, he was sidelined for almost two decades, resuming his academic positions 24 years later. But throughout his life Li was always proud of his label as a rightist.<br />In the New Anti-Rightist Movement in early 2000, Mr. Li, together with several other prominent liberal intellectuals, was advised by the authorities that they were writing reactionary and bourgeois liberal articles and they were warned to be aware of the consequences. Notwithstanding the numerous penalties and frustrations, Li was optimistic with China’s future, not because its political transition will be completed very soon, but because of his confidence in democratic-based individual freedom and its inevitability for China.<br />As a dear friend to many younger liberal intellectuals and liberal-minded Communist officials, Mr. Li was a historical figure that ruled the intellectual scene for the past decade. His voice was an important dimension in the contemporary changes underway in China. Posterity will be left to decide his position in the liberal movement in contemporary intellectual history. It is certain, however, that his heroic courage and deep love of individual freedom and democracy are widely appreciated in China. Mr. Li died of pneumonia resulting from repeated cold, partly due to the uniform cutting off of central heating on March 15, 2003 despite the continued cold weather in Beijing. A small memorial tribute was held on Friday, May 9, in Beijing to commemorate his loss. The liberal intelligentsia sent their collective condolences and remembrances to Li’s family. His survivors include his wife and four children.&lt;/p&gt;<br />&lt;p&gt;<br />原载于华尔街日报亚洲版 The Wall Street Journal Asian Edition. March 14,. 2003.
